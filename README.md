# Deep Learning-Based Action Recognition for Digital Interventions in Diabetes Management

## Overview

Effective diabetes management requires real-time monitoring, accurate glucose prediction, and actionable feedback to prevent glucose excursions and optimize patient outcomes. Traditional methods often fail to address the complexity and individual variability of glucose dynamics. This project proposes a novel deep learning-based framework for action recognition and intervention in diabetes management, integrating advanced predictive modeling with user-centric feedback mechanisms.

The core of the system is the **Adaptive Glucose Monitoring Model (AGM)**, which utilizes a multi-channel feature encoder and temporal prediction module to accurately forecast blood glucose levels while incorporating a personalization layer to account for individual differences. The **Digital Diabetes Assistant (DDA)** works alongside AGM to provide real-time risk assessment, personalized recommendations for diet, activity, insulin adjustments, and long-term behavioral insights to promote patient adherence and engagement.

## Features

- **Adaptive Glucose Monitoring Model (AGM)**:
  - Multi-channel feature encoder for precise glucose prediction
  - Temporal prediction module to capture glucose dynamics over time
  - Personalization layer to adapt predictions to individual profiles

- **Digital Diabetes Assistant (DDA)**:
  - Real-time risk assessment to monitor blood glucose levels
  - Personalized recommendations for diet, physical activity, and insulin adjustments
  - Long-term behavioral insights to encourage adherence and self-management

- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides actionable insights to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and optimize glycemic control.

- **Sustainable Diabetes Management**: Focuses on long-term behavioral changes and adherence for sustainable diabetes care.

## Experimental Results

Our experimental results demonstrate that this framework can significantly enhance glycemic control, reduce the risks of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and promote sustainable self-management practices for individuals with diabetes.
